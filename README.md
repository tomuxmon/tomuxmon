## My journey

I was born in [Lithuania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania). I have 1 older sister and 2 older brothers. My parents are hard working event at this day, they never stop. I grew up with little supervision and thus I managed to retain my natuaral curiosity. At school I was not a social type of person. I had a hard stance on my views and I was realy hard to argue with. I had only one friend, arm wrewstler, really good one. I loved Math and Physics classes a lot. Geometry was my thing, it felt like playing games. As an extracurricular activity I have joined computer classes early on. Geometry had to slide aside. After school I have immediately started studying Computer Science. What a mistake. I was ready to study but not ready to take care of myself. Food I ate was terrible and I have exausted my body in a haf a year. I could not take it anymore and dropped out. Started again next year and dropped out again. Young and stupid me. Then I joined Lithuanian Armed forces. I swore I would never do it when I was younger, but here I am. The year was life changing both phisicaly and mentally. After a year I knew what I need to change in my life so I do not need to go to army anymore üòÉ. I have finished Bachelors and Master degree studies in Klaipƒóda. Being social was a thing for me now and I have joined [Klaipƒóda University Student Union](https://kuss.lt/en/).

### Professional life starts

While studying for Masters degree I have found myself a job at [UAB Omega Technology](https://omega365.com/locations/klaipeda). A great place to start. Norwegians being the founders even more so true. The main [product in Omega365](https://www.omega365.com/products) is [PIMS](https://www.omega365.com/products/omega-pims) among others. But I was more fit to work on technology not the products. Most of the time there I have spent on [Appframe](https://docs.omega365.com/?Area-ID=10003): a suite of tools and a framework to create products. I have gained tremendous amounts of knowledge and experience there (~9% of my life there ü§Ø). SQL Server is in a forefront in Omega365. Also, [.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com) is all over the place: on Servers, Windows UI, Tools. Most of the time I spent in a technology department and tooling was my passion. I hope I have managed to contribute to the success of the technology and products they create.

- I had an opportunity to learn SQL from the best. At some point they wanted me to rewrite SQL template engine from .Net to SQL and I did. It was challenging and fun. A sneak peak at [SQL Templates](https://docs.omega365.com/?Area-ID=10003&Name=SOL-PROC-USG-00594) at Omega 365 documentation site.
- Implemented automatic tracking of the dependencies: database objects, .Net libraries, Windows Apps, Web Apps... It is like dependabot but for .Net and SQL Server only. To make it automatic I needed to dive into [CIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIL) dissasembly and analysis. [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy) was used extensively to learn how compiled DLL's look inside.
- Created initial version of [code analyzer](https://docs.omega365.com/?Area-ID=10003&Name=SOL-PROC-USG-00092) a backend to write lints to your components. My passion led my to write initial lints for SQL. Used [TSQL parser](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.SqlParser/) under the hood. Also authored some lints for .Net libraries using [cecil](https://github.com/jbevain/cecil).
- Had a blast implementing [the updater](https://docs.omega365.com/?Area-ID=10003&Name=SOL-PROC-USG-00635) for them (initial version took 2 weeks to implement). Had a chance to use technologies created by myself like `SQL Templates` mentioned earlier.
- Contributed a lot to [MSI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/windows-installer-portal) and [ClickOnce](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/deployment/clickonce-security-and-deployment?view=vs-2022) build tooling. Started using [WIX toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/) at the time. I must say ClickOnce is my least favorite tech out there. If you can, avoid it. [WIX toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/) on the other hand is great. As my hobby project I have created a solution to author [MSI packages for Godot executable](https://github.com/tomuxmon/godot.msi)

### The pandemic crysis

We all live our happy lives. And then we do not. For me it felt like waking up from a dream. Not a bad one, but I knew I needed something else besides [SQL server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) and [.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com) in my profesional life. I left my happy life in Omega and started working for [Vaultspeed](https://vaultspeed.com/). Automation is the thing they do. Specifically they take on task of porting your data models to [DataVault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_vault_modeling). They have a solution to generate code so you do not have to write it by hand. Tech stack at Vaultspeed is [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) with some [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/) code to do the code generation. Had a decent exposure to postgres and fell in love with it. But the only thing I really contributed is [Spark Structured streaming](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html) proof of concept. It was a blast and interesting opportunity. During the time I had a chance to remember [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and had adapted [spark structured streaming jdbc sink](https://github.com/tomuxmon/spark-structured-streaming-jdbc-sink) to what Vaultspeed needs. They have a very rigid and I would say Academic structure of prototyping. I had to document my proof of concept end to end. Good thing I love documenting stuff üòÉ. Too bad it is not open source...

### Kids booming

Work at Vaultspeed was 99% remote. I was working from home most of the time. Being at home means you get to see all your family around. Great for family bonding not so great for the business üòÉ. And so me and my wife, we wait for our third child... I have decided to leave Vaultspeed and take 1 year of child care. Planned so many things. A lot of spare time right?! When my daughter was 6 months I finally started getting some "spare" time. Being with my kids is great, but after my child care ends I still have to feed them. I took on my [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) jurney seriously... And started creating games üòÉ.

### Learning Rust

I tied a lot of things. Started with the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html). Then jumped into [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises. Went on to the [Exercism Rust track](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust). Tried reading [Rust in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action). Found [Hands-on Rust](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust/) and it clicked. Followed it through and the result is [here](https://github.com/tomuxmon/dungeoncrawl). Then followed [Bevy Minesweeper](https://dev.to/qongzi/bevy-minesweeper-introduction-4l7f) tutorial series, the result is [here](https://github.com/tomuxmon/bevy_mines). Then I started my own project - [bevy roguelike](https://github.com/tomuxmon/bevy_roguelike). I got to write my own Rust code for the first time. [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) engine felt right for me. You define some data structures in Rust and then write some functions to manipulate those data structurees and the ones defined by Bevy. And that is basically it, simple and elegant. You can create any game with that. Now I am ready for the next level and starting to read [Rust for Rustaceans](https://rust-for-rustaceans.com/). I know it is going to be fun!
